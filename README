A quick and nasty library I whipped up that converts most of popular online naming silliness into something that minimises the chances of identity confusion.


This means people can go nuts with 1334 style characters or deliberate attempts to look like someone else's handle and it should hopefully get detected:

"HelloWorld", "hEllo      wor1d" and "|-|3110 |/\|O|?1|)" all get translated to "helloworld"
