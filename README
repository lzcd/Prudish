A quick and nasty library I whipped up that converts most of popular online naming silliness into something that minimises the chances of identity confusion.

e.g. People can go nuts with 1334 style characters or deliberate attempts to look like someone else's handle and it should hopefully get detected:

"|-|3110 |/\|O|?1|)" gets translated to "helloworld"
